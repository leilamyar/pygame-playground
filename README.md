# pygame-playground

I'm helping Ninjas from 12 to 18 to code their own game with Pygame during [CoderDojo](https://www.coderdojobelgium.be/en)'s workshops.
This repo is for me to learn and use the Pygame lib myself first.

I'm using the code from this tutorial : https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/
